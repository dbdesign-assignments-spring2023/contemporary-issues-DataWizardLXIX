# Contemporary Issues in Data - Is There Too Much Data?

This is a presentation of the discussion about whether having access to too much data is a problem; the discussion about data availability is presented using two opposing views retrieved from Forbes and the Futuramo Blog respectively.

## Article 1
In [_Why, Yes, There Is Such A Thing As Too Much Data (And Why You Should Care)_](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/01/03/why-yes-there-is-such-a-thing-as-too-much-data-and-why-you-should-care/?sh=138cdb8e4c39), Elik Eizenberg makes the argument that there's a "data overload" and conveys, what she believes to be, the issues with this overload. 

While I understand the idea of problematizing “data overload”, in which organizations and individuals have access to more data than what they can effectively use, I do not believe that not being able to use all the data efficiently is explicitly an issue; I believe that data overload is an incentive for us to keep improving our ability to analyze and use all the good data that’s available to us.

I further believe that access to a large amount of data can only serve to enhance business decision-making (one of many examples in which data is useful). What I personally do believe to be a hypothetical issue, would be if we had all the necessary tools to effectively use/analyze large chunks of data, but were held back due to limited amounts of good data.

## Article 2  
In Mathias Lanni's article [_Is there such a thing as too much data_?](https://futuramo.com/blog/is-there-such-thing-like-too-much-data/), he contributes  to the discussion by providing an opposing view and solution to Elik Eizenberg's problematization.

Throughout the text, Lanni makes some great points on data, the following is an extraction from his article:
>There can be too much unsorted data.
>There can be too many databases which need to be consolidated.
>There can be too much false data.
>But when the **data is good**, there’s **no such thing as too much of it**.

I agree with this perspective - that the concern shouldn't primarily be about having too much data, but rather the inability to effectively utilize all the valuable data that is available to us.

The author raises a valid concern about the abundance of data that is now available, specifically in regards to regulations and ethical considerations. Moreover, the question of whether or collecting of all available data is truly necessary for e.g. making efficient business decisions is asked - I believe that this is the correct problematization of data availability and should be discussed, as opposed to the problematization presented in the first article. This is a topic that will continue to be important as technology and data availability keeps improving.
